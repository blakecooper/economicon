			<p>Sincerely, thank you for taking the time to play test this game... and apologies if you find it boring, frustrating or even unplayable at this early stage.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Getting ready to play</h2>

		<p>Each player sits around a table and sets up their reserve bank in front of them.
		<p>Start with these resources in your reserve bank:
		<p><ul>
				<li>Gold: 10 units</li>
				<li>Currency (yours): 8 unites</li>
			</ul>

		<p>In the center of the table is the market: almost everything you and your fellow players buy or sell during a game of Economicon passes through the market. 
		<p>Start with theses resources in the market:
		<p><ul>
				<li>Gold: 8 units</li>
				<li>Goods: 4 grain, 2 oil, 1 tech</li>
				<li>Currency: 1 of each</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>The basic idea</h2>

		<p><b>Economicon is a resource trading game whose core mechanic is based on supply and demand</b>: when fewer resources are available in the market, those resources become more valuable. 
		<p>Any time you are buying, selling or otherwise trading in Economicon, the value of a unit is determined in real time by dividing the number of units you’re paying with in the global market by the number of units you’re buying in the global market. 

		<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
			<h4>Example</h4>
			<p>Say you want to use the gold in your reserve bank to buy grain on the global market. There are currently 5 units of gold in the market, and 7 units of grain. So the cost for each unit of grain is <b>5/7</b> = roughly .71 units of gold. In Economicon, rounding goes to the nearest .25, so in this case each unit of grain cost .75 gold.
		</div>

		<p>By strategically buying up resources (or, inversely, flooding the market with them), you can raise or lower the value of those resources in a way that affects every player’s purchasing power, and the value of their reserve holdings.

		<h2>Winning the game</h2>

		<p>At the end of the game, the player with the most valuable reserve bank holdings wins, if they have fewer than three volatility tokens.

		<h2>Rounds</h2>
		<div id="rounds"></div>

		<h2>Definitions</h2>

		<h4>Commodities</h4>

		<p>There are three commodities in Economicon: grain, oil and tech. Commodities are produced by nations, and bought and sold on the open market. A nation's population also consumes commodities each turn. Commodities can be used as a currency peg. 
		
		<h4>Consumption Requirement</h4>

		<p>Each round, the citizens of your nation will consume a number of commodities from your central reserve bank equal to the number of laws in effect. When commodities are consumed in this way, discard them from play.

		<h4>Currency</h4>

		<p>Currency is used by nations to make purchases. Its value is determined either by the value of the unit to which it is "pegged," or by its own scarcity on the market (if no peg is determined). Currency can also be bought and sold in the marketplace, and a player can use another player's currency as their currency's peg.

		<h4>Currency Peg</h4>
		<div id="currencyPeg"></div>

		<h4>Global Events</h4>
		<div id="globalEvents"></div>

		<h4>Gold</h4>

		<p>Gold works a little differently than commodities or currency. <b>It is mined</b>, not created, meaning its supply is more stable. <b>Gold counts as a universal currency</b>, meaning every player may use their supply of gold to pay for their purchases. <b>Players can also peg their currency to the value of gold.</b> <b>The banker with the most gold in reserves gets to go first</b> whenever order of play matters. At the end of the game, <b>gold is the unit of currency used to determine the value of your reserve holdings</b>. 
		
		<h4>Laws</h4>
		<div id="laws"></div>

		<h4>Mining</h4>

		<p>At the beginning of each round, every nation mines gold by rolling a d6, and placing that number of new units of gold into their reserves.

		<h4>Native currency</h4>

		<p>Native currency refers to the currency your nation uses to make purchases. Each nation has its own standard currency it can use for this purpose. <b>Any nation can also use gold to make purchases.</b> Other currencies and even commodities may also be used as native currency under special circumstances (when stated).

		<h4>Order of play</h4>

		<p>When relevant (e.g., during the trading phase), <b>players take turns in order based on who has the most gold in reserves</b>.. Ties are broken by rolling dice.

		<h4>Production</h4>
		<div id="production"></div>

		<h4>Production Cost</h4>

		<p>The cost to produce any commodity is equal to <b>half the commodity's value on the open market</b>.

		<h4>Production Requirement</h4>

		<p>Each round during the production phase, your population must be put to work producing at least one of each type of commodity per law in effect. You must be able to pay all production costs to meet this requirement.

		<h4>Reserve bank</h4>
		<div id="reserveBank"></div>

		<h4>Rewards and penalties</h4>

		<p>If during a given round you complied with both your nation's production and consumption requirements, and its laws, you may add one gold to your reserves and remove one volatility token. Otherwise, gain a volatility token.

		<h4>Resolving the global event</h4>

		<p>The final action in a given round, determine whether the players were successful in achieving the goal stated on the card. Enact the "Success" or "Failure" outcomes as appropriate.

		<h4>Trading</h4>
		<div id="trading"></div>

		<h4>Unit</h4>

		<p>A unit refers to one token of any type of currency, commodity or gold. 

		<h4>Value</h4>
		<div id="value"></div>

		<h4>Volatility token</h4>
		<div id="volatilityTokens"></div>
