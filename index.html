			<h1><b>Economicon</b></h1>
            <h4>A game of macroeconomics and trading</h4>

		<h2>Welcome to Economicon!</h2>
		
        <p>When playing Economicon, you assume the role of the mightiest of all bureaucrats: the central banker. Your goal is to achieve a stable economy and a prosperous nation, while contending with mandates from lawmakers and navigating chaotic global events.

			<p><b>2020-02-03:</b> Another play test, another update! <a href="economicon-reference-0_3.pdf" target="_blank">Download the latest Economicon rules reference card (v. 0.3) here</a>.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>The basic idea</h2>

        <p><b>Economicon is a trading game</b> where the value of things change based on supply and demand.</p>

        <p>You and your fellow players will respond to global events, while also trying to achieve personal mandates, through trading. But be careful: every trade you make has the potential to affect the value of your (and your fellow players') personal holdings, which might include gold, commodities (like grain, oil and tech) and currency (both yours and that of other players).</p>
        
        <p>To win Economicon, claim more achievements, while building a more valuable economy, than your fellow players. Good luck!</p>
        
		<h2>Setting up the game</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Choose your native currency</li>
            <li>Place the starting resources in your bank:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Gold:</b> 10 units</li>
                    <li><b>Native currency:</b> 8 units            
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Set up the market:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Gold:</b> 4 units</li>
                <li><b>Others:</b> 1 unit each</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Draw two <b>mandates</b> for your nation
            </li>
            <li>Determine the <b>starting player:</b> roll a d6. Highest roll goes first.
            </li>
        </ol>

		<h2>Playing the game</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Draw a <b>global event</b></li>
            <li>Beginning with the starting player and moving clockwise, each player takes their turn. This continues for the number of rounds indicated by the global event.
            <br>During your turn, take <u>two</u> actions:
        <ul>
            <li>First, take a <b>generate</b> action:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Produce:</b> Pay either gold or your native currency to add an equivalent amount of any one commodity to your bank (see <a class="indoc" href="#valuecounts">"Using value counts"</a>). When you do, add an additional commodity for free.</li>
                <li><b>Mine gold:</b> Add two gold to your bank.</li>
                <li><b>Print currency:</b> If there is more gold in your bank than your native currency, add up to the difference in native currency to your bank. Then, pay one gold.</li>
                <li><b>Draw a new mandate.</b> Then, discard one mandate.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Second, you may take another generate action, or <b>trade</b>:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Trade:</b> exchange one resource in your bank for an equivalent amount of another resource in the market  (see <a href="#valuecounts">"Using value counts"</a>).
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Commodities</b> can only be traded for <b>gold</b> or <b>your native currency</b>.</li>
                    <li><b>Currency</b> (excluding your native currency) can only be traded for another currency, or gold.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <br>At any time during your turn, when you complete a mandate, you can either <b>claim an achievement</b> or <b>remove a volatility point</b>. 
                
            </li>
            <li><b>Resolve the global event</b> by declaring your response a success or failure, then taking the corresponding action.</li>
            <li>Resolve your <b>consumption requirement</b>. Discard one of each commodity in your bank for every uncompleted mandate you hold. If you cannot pay your nation's consumption requirement, gain a <b>volatility point</b>.</li>
        <li>Draw a new mandate.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 1 - 4 until five global events have been resolved.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2 id="valuecounts">Using value counts</h2>
            <p>Everything in the market has a <b>value</b> count, a number that determines how many of one resource should be traded for another.</p>

            <p>If there are fewer than 5 of a resource available in the market, that resource's value count is 1. If there are 5 of a resource available in the market, and for every 5 added after that, the value count increases by 1.</p>

		<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
			<h4>Example: using value counts</h4>
            
            <p>Any time you <b>produce</b> a commodity or execute a <b>trade</b> of any kind, you will compare value counts to determine how much of one thing to pay or trade for another.</p>

            <p><b>When producing a commodity</b>, first pay an amount of either gold or your native currency equal to its value count. Then, add an amount of any one commodity to your bank equal to that commodity's value count, plus one additional unit (this is a unique of production).</p>

            <p><b>When trading</b>, you will always get an amount of something equal to its value count by exchanging an amount of something else equal to its value count.</p>
            
            <p>You must always produce or trade a minimum number of resources equal to their value counts, but may produce or trade any multiple of that resource's value count. So, if grain's value count is 3, you must trade for <u>at least</u> 3 grain, but may also trade for 6, 9 or 12 grain (etc.), provided you have enough gold or native currency to pay for it.</p>

		<h2>Winning the game</h2>

        <p>The winner of Economicon is the player with the most achievements after five global events have been resolved <b>without having three or greater volatility points.</b></p>
        
        <div class="bd-callout bd-callout-danger">
			<h4>Any player with three or greater volatility points <u>cannot</u> win the game!</h4>
			<p>You can remove volatility points by completing mandates or succeeding in global events.</p>
		</div>

        <p>To determine your total achievements, add your achievements from completed mandates and successful global events (when applicable), then claim any bonus achievements:</p>

            <li><b>Commodities trader (1 bonus achievement):</b> Hold more commodities in your bank than any other player</li>
