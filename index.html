			<h1><b>Economicon</b></h1>
			<p>Rules Document v. 0.1
			<br>Updated 2019-11-07</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Welcome to Economicon!</h2>
		<p>When playing Economicon, you assume the role of the mightiest of all bureaucrats: the central banker. Your goal is to build a stable economy and a prosperous nation.		

		<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
			<h4>Thank you (a disclaimer)</h4>
			<p><b>This is the first-ever round of play testing!</b> I hope this game is fun, challenging and competitive... but I won't know until you play it! Please share your feedback using the <a href="https://forms.gle/iVnNveo85b9exVC37" target="_blank">play tester evaluation form</a>.</p>
			<p>Seriously, thank you for taking the time to play test this game... and apologies if you find it boring, frustrating or even unplayable at this early stage.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>The basic idea</h2>

		<p><b>Economicon is a resource trading game based on supply and demand</b>.  When fewer resources are available, those resources become more valuable. 
		<p>Any time you buy, sell or trade in Economicon, the cost of a unit is calculated using the following formula:

		<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
			<h4>Value formula</h4>
		<p>  \[cost = { {The\ available\ number\ of\ units\ you're\ \textbf{paying}\ with} \over {The\ available\ number\ of\ units\ you're\ \textbf{buying}}}\]
		</div>
		<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
			<h4>Example</h4>
			<p>Say you have a pile of gold burning a hole in your reserve bank, and you need to buy 2 grain to meet your nation's <a href="#consumptionrequirement">consumption requirement</a> this turn.
			<p>There are currently <b>5 gold</b> in the market, and <b>7 grain</b>. So the cost for each unit of grain is <b>5/7</b> = roughly .71 gold per unit of grain. <b>Rounding goes to the nearest .25 in Economicon</b>, so <b>each unit of grain cost .75 gold.</b> You pay 1.5 gold from reserves, and the grain is yours! 
			<p>The player after you had exactly the same idea: they want to spend their gold to buy 2 grain. Now there are <b>5 grain</b> in the market. <b>So when the next player goes to buy 2 grain, each unit will cost 5/5 = 1 unit of gold.</b>
			<p>The next player will pay more because grain is now scarcer, and therefore more valuable. 
		</div>

		<p>By strategically buying up resources (or, inversely, flooding the market with them), you can raise or lower the value of those resources in a way that affects every player's purchasing power, and the value of the resources they already own.

		<h2>Winning the game</h2>

		<p>At the end of the game, each player adds up the value of all holdings in their <a href="#reservebank">reserve bank</a>. The player whose holdings are valued the highest wins... as long as they have fewer than three <a href="#volatilitytokens">volatility tokens</a>.

		<h2>Getting ready to play</h2>

		<p>Each player sets up their reserve bank in front of them.
		<p>Start with these resources in your reserve bank:
		<p><ul>
				<li><b>Gold:</b> 10 units</li>
				<li><b>Currency (yours):</b> 8 units</li>
			</ul>

		<p>In the center of the table, set up the marketplace: 
		<p><ul>
				<li><b>Gold:</b> 8 units</li>
				<li><b>Commodities:</b> 4 grain, 2 oil, 1 tech</li>
				<li><b>Currency:</b> 1 of each</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Last, set your nation's <a href="#exchangerate">exchange rate</a> to gold: place one unit of gold on your exchange rate token.

		<h2>Playing the game</h2>
		<p>A game of Economicon takes place during a number of rounds agreed to by the players.

		<p>During each round, in order:
			<ul class='list-group'>
				<li class='list-group-item'><b>1. Gold is mined.</b><br>Each player rolls a d6, and adds that amount of gold to their nation's reserves.</li>
				<li class='list-group-item'><b>2. A global event occurs.</b><br>One global event card is placed face up in the play area. It remains in effect until resolved at end of round.</li>
				<li class='list-group-item'><b>3. Bankers may change their exchange rate.</b><br>See the <a href="#exchangerate">Exchange Rate</a> section for details.<br>If you change your nation's currency exchange rate two rounds in a row, immediately gain a volatility token.<br>If you have removed your currency peg during the game, then later reapply it, immediately gain a volatility token.</li>
				<li class='list-group-item'><b>5. Laws are ratified (turns 1, 3, 6 and 10).</b><br>Each player draws a law card and places it face up in their play area. Unless otherwise directed, it remains in effect for the rest of the game.</li>
				<li class='list-group-item'><b>6. Commodities are produced.</b><br>See the <a href="#production">Production</a> section for details.<br>Each player mandates a certain amount of each of the game's three commodities to be produced by their nation to hold in reserves or sell on the market. Your nation must be able to pay all production using the gold or native currency in your reservess.<p>Failure to meet production requirements may result in gaining a volatility token at the end of the round.</li>
				<li class='list-group-item'><b>7. Trade is conducted.</b><br>Taking turns, each player chooses to do one of the following:
					<br><b>Sell:</b> Move any number of commodities from your reserves to the market.
					<br><b>Buy:</b> Purchase any number of a single commodity's available units by moving them from the top of the stack in the market into reserves. Pay each player who produced commodites your puchase their market value.
					<br><b>Exchange:</b> Exchange foreign currency in your reserves for your native currency (or vice versa). You can also exchange using gold.
					<br><b>Pass:</b> When all players pass, the trade phase is over.
				</li>
				<li class='list-group-item'><b>8. Commodities are consumed.</b><br>The people of your nation consume a number of each of the three commodities equal to the number of laws currently in effect for your nation. Discard this number of each commodity from your reserves</li>
				<li class='list-group-item'><b>9. Rewards and penalties are distributed.</b><br>If during this round you complied with both your nation's production and consumption requirements, and its laws, you may remove one volatility token. Otherwise, gain a volatility token.</li>
				<li class='list-group-item'><b>10. Resolve the global event.</b><br>The outcome will be specific to the event, and determined by whether the players were successful or failed in meeting their goal.</li></ul>

		<h2>Definitions</h2>

		<h4>Commodities</h4>

		<p>There are three commodities in Economicon: grain, oil and steel.
		<p>Players can <a href="#production">produce</a> commodities by paying half their <a href="#value">market value</a>. Once you have produced commodities, you can sell them in the <a href="#market">market</a>, and buy other player's commodities.
		<p>Keeping commodities in your <a href="#reservebank">reserves</a> is a great way to control the market, build the value of your holdings and ensure that your nation's <a href="#consumptionrequirement">consumption requirements</a> are met.
			
		<h4 id="consumptionrequirement">Consumption Requirement</h4>

		<p>Each round, the citizens of your nation will consume a number of commodities from your central reserve bank equal to the number of laws in effect. When commodities are consumed in this way, discard them from play.

		<h4>Currency</h4>

		<p>Currency is used by nations to make purchases. Its value is determined either by the value of the unit to which it is "pegged," or by its own scarcity on the market (if no peg is determined). Currency can also be bought and sold in the marketplace, and a player can use another player's currency as their currency's peg.

		<h4 id="exchangerate">Exchange Rate</h4>
		
		<p>Each turn, you may 'peg' your currency to another unit by declaring one unit of your currency to be worth one unit of your chosen peg: gold, a commodity, or another player's currency. Currency doesn't have to pegged to another unit, however. If your currency has no peg, its value is determined by its own scarcity in the market.
		
		<p>Each peg has its own advantages, and risks:

		<p><b>Pegging to gold</b> makes your currency's value more stable, since gold can only be produced by mining. But, since gold is a universal currency, you gain no unique advantage to using it to pay for purchases.

		<p><b>Pegging to commodities like wheat, oil or tech</b> allows you to spend that commodity from your reserves as though it were your native currency, giving you more buying power. But the value of commodities can be unpredictable, because other players can produce, buy and sell commodities at will, causing shortages or surpluses that dramatically affect supply and demand.
		<p><b>Pegging to another nation's currency</b> gives you the added security of tying your value to another player with a vested interest in maintaining its value and stability, effectively creating a de facto partnership, if not an official one. You also have the powerful benefit of trading directly with that nation: you may buy sell directly with that nation, without trading on the market (although you still pay market value). However, this subjugates your currency's value to the actions of another player. If they devalue or inflates their currency, deliberately or otherwise, you will indirectly suffer the consequences.
		<p><b>Removing your currency peg altogether</b> is the only way to unlock one useful feature of the game: manipulating your currency's value by creating and destroying it at will. With no currency peg, you may at any time add new units of your currency to your resrves, or remove it from the game. This powerful control on supply and demand gives you the acute ability to manage your currency's value. But it can be its own downside, as you may unintentionally introduce inflation or deflation, crippling your economy in the process.
		<p>If you remove your peg and then re-peg your currency to another unit, gain a volatility token. If you change your peg in any round where you also changed your peg in the previous round, you immediately gain a volatility token."

		<h4>Global Events</h4>
		
		<p>Global event cards are drawn once at the beginning of each round, and stay in effect for the rest of the round. Global event cards describe conditions that take effect this round, a common goal for all players to meet, and consequences if the goal is or is not met by the final phase of the round.

		<h4>Gold</h4>

		<p>Gold works a little differently than commodities or currency. <b>It is mined</b>, not created, meaning its supply is more stable. <b>Gold counts as a universal currency</b>, meaning every player may use their supply of gold to pay for their purchases. <b>Players can also peg their currency to the value of gold.</b> <b>The banker with the most gold in reserves gets to go first</b> whenever order of play matters. At the end of the game, <b>gold is the unit of currency used to determine the value of your reserve holdings</b>. 
		
		<h4>Laws</h4>
		
		<p>Law cards, under normal circumstances, are drawn once by players during rounds 1, 3 and 6 and remain in play for the remainder of the game. They describe conditions, representing laws passed in your country, to which you must adhere. If you fail to comply with one or more of your nation's laws in a given round, gain a volatility token.

		<h4 id="market">Global Market</h4>

		<p>TODO

		<h4>Mining</h4>

		<p>At the beginning of each round, every nation mines gold by rolling a d6, and placing that number of new units of gold into their reserves.

		<h4>Native currency</h4>

		<p>Native currency refers to the currency your nation uses to make purchases. Each nation has its own standard currency it can use for this purpose. <b>Any nation can also use gold to make purchases.</b> Other currencies and even commodities may also be used as native currency under special circumstances (when stated).

		<h4>Order of play</h4>

		<p>When relevant (e.g., during the trading phase), <b>players take turns in order based on who has the most gold in reserves</b>.. Ties are broken by rolling dice.

		<h4 id="production">Production</h4>
		
		<p>During the production phase of each round, players may produce commodities by paying an amount equal to 1/2 the relative market value of that commodity.
			
		<p>Nations may produce commodities all at once, or follow the standard order of play, as agreed upon by the group. All nations set their commodities aside until the trading round before placing them in the market. Players may also choose to hide the number and type of commodities produced from other players until the trading phase.
		<p>Production requirements state that each nation must produce at least one of all three commodities (grain, oil and tech) to maintain their nation's low unemployment rate. If they fail to do so, they gain a volatility token later in the round."

		<h4>Production Cost</h4>

		<p>The cost to produce any commodity is equal to <b>half the commodity's value on the open market</b>.

		<h4>Production Requirement</h4>

		<p>Each round during the production phase, your population must be put to work producing at least one of each type of commodity per law in effect. You must be able to pay all production costs to meet this requirement.

		<h4 id="reservebank">Reserve bank</h4>
		
		<p>A nation's central reserve bank is where all gold, commodities and currencies belonging to the nation are kept.
			
		<p>The amount of gold held by players in their reserves determines the play order. The player whose nation has the most gold gets to go first whenever the order of play matters.<p>Bankers use gold and native currency in their reserves to make purchases in the market. When they do, they determine the relative value of their purchase and place that amount of gold or native currency in the market from their reserves.<p>At the end of the game, players count up the value of all gold, commodities and currency in their reserve, relative to gold (that is, the amount of gold in the market is the numerator in the value formula). If a player has the most valuable reserves, without having three or greater volatility tokens, that player wins the game.

		<h4>Rewards and penalties</h4>

		<p>If during a given round you complied with both your nation's production and consumption requirements, and its laws, you may add one gold to your reserves and remove one volatility token. Otherwise, gain a volatility token.

		<h4>Resolving the global event</h4>

		<p>The final action in a given round, determine whether the players were successful in achieving the goal stated on the card. Enact the "Success" or "Failure" outcomes as appropriate.

		<h4>Trading</h4>
	
		<p>During the trading phase, players take turns doing one of the following actions:

					<br><b>Sell:</b> Move any number of commodities from your reserves to the market.
					<br><b>Buy:</b> Purchase any number of a single commodity's available units by moving them from the top of the stack in the market into reserves. Pay each player who produced commodites your puchase their market value.
					<br><b>Exchange:</b> Exchange foreign currency in your reserves for your native currency (or vice versa). You can also exchange using gold.
					<br><b>Pass:</b> When all players pass, the trade phase is over.
		

		<h4>Unit</h4>

		<p>A unit refers to one token of any type of currency, commodity or gold. 

		<h4 id="value">>Value</h4>
		<p>As in real life, the value of a gold, commodities and currency in Economicon is relative, based on supply and demand. The more scarce something is, the more you can expect to pay for it.
		<p>Using a currency peg is a way to assign a value for your currency other than its inherent scarcity. When using a peg, your currency is exactly as valuable as the unit you have pegged it to.<p>When determining how much a commodity costs in Economicon, use the following formula:


		<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
			<h4>Value formula</h4>
		<p>  \[cost = { {The\ available\ number\ of\ units\ you're\ \textbf{paying}\ with} \over {The\ available\ number\ of\ units\ you're\ \textbf{buying}}}\]
		</div>


		<p>If you're paying with your native currency, and that currency is pegged to the value of another unit, count that unit in the marketplace instead of your currency when using the value formula. 

		<p>Rounding: Always round to the nearest .25. 

		<h4 id="volatilitytokens">Volatility token</h4>
		<p>There are three situations in which you may earn a volatility token:<p>1. If your nation fails to meet the production or consumption requirement<br>2. If you fail to comply with your nations laws<br>3. Based on your response to global events<p>You can remove one volatility token per round during your upkeep phase if you comply with all requirements and laws. Certain global events can also result in the removal of volatility tokens.
