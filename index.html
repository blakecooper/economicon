			<h1><b>Economicon</b></h1>
            <h4>A game of macroeconomics and trading</h4>
			<p>Rules Document v. 0.2
			<br>Updated 2020-01-28</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>Welcome to Economicon!</h2>
		<p>When playing Economicon, you assume the role of the mightiest of all bureaucrats: the central banker. Your goal is to achieve a stable economy and a prosperous nation, while contending with mandates from lawmakers and navigating chaotic global events.

		<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
			<h4>Updates</h4>
			<p><b>2020-01-28:</b> Now you can <a href="economicon-reference-0_2.pdf" target="_blank">download the new, handy Economicon rules reference card (v. 0.2)</a>.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>The basic idea</h2>

        <p><b>Economicon is a resource trading game</b> where the value of things change based on supply and demand.</p>

        <p>You and your fellow players will each be trying to claim personal and public achievements through trading. Every trade you make has the potential to affect the value of your (and your fellow players') personal holdings, which might include gold, commodities (like grain, steel, oil and tech) and currency (both yours and that of other players).</p>
        
        <p>Every achievement you claim counts toward your victory points. But certain actions, like having unclaimed mandates or failing to respond to certain global events, will earn you volatility points, which count against you.</p> 
        
        <p>At the end of the game, the player with the most victory points wins.</p>

		<h2>Setting up the game</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Choose your nation:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Blue</b> produces <u>one extra tech</u> for free, but <u>cannot produce grain</u></li>
                    <li><b>Green</b> produces <u>one extra grain</u> for free, but <u>cannot produce oil</u></li>
                    <li><b>White</b> produces <u>one extra steel</u> for free, but <u>cannot produce tech</u></li>
                    <li><b>Red</b> produces <u>one extra oil</u> for free, but <u>cannot produce steel</u></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Set up your reserve bank:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Gold:</b> 10 units</li>
                    <li><b>Native currency:</b> 8 units            
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Set up the markets:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Gold:</b> 4 units</li>
                <li><b>Grain:</b> 4 units (randomly chosen)</li>
                <li><b>Steel:</b> 4 units (randomly chosen)</li>
                <li><b>Oil:</b> 2 units (randomly chosen)</li>
                <li><b>Tech:</b> 1 unit (randomly chosen)</li>
                <li><b>Currency:</b> 1 unit from each player</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Draw two <b>mandate cards</b> for your nation
            </li>
            <li>Determine the <b>starting player</b>--roll a d6. Highest roll goes first. Players tied for highest keep rolling until one player rolls highest.
            </li>
        </ol>

		<h2>Playing the game</h2>
        
        		<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
			<h4>Value formula</h4>
            <p>The value of <b>one unit</b> equals:</p>
            <p>The number of units in the markets of the type you're trading <b>with</b></p>
            <p><b>-divided by-</b></p>
            <p>The number of the units in the markets of the type you're trading <b>for</b></p>
		</div>

		<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
			<h4>Example</h4>
			<p>Say you have a pile of <a href="#gold">gold</a> burning a hole in your <a href="#reservebank">reserve bank</a>, and you need to buy 2 grain to meet your nation's <a href="#consumptionrequirement">consumption requirement</a>.
			<p>There are currently <b>5 gold</b> in the market, and <b>7 grain</b>. So the cost for each unit of grain is <b>5/7</b> = roughly .71 gold per unit of grain. <b>Rounding goes to the nearest .25 in Economicon</b>, so <b>each unit of grain cost .75 gold.</b> You pay 1.5 gold from reserves, and the grain is yours! 
			<p>The player after you had exactly the same idea: they want to spend their gold to buy 2 grain. Now there are <b>5 grain</b> in the market. <b>So when the next player goes to buy 2 grain, each unit will cost 5/5 = 1 unit of gold.</b>
			<p>The next player will pay more because grain is now scarcer, and therefore more valuable. 
		</div>

		<p>To begin, flip the first global event card. Each global event card describes a scenario, conditions for resolving that scenario, a number of rounds of trading in which to resolve the scenario, and consequences upon success or failure. During a game of Economicon, players will respond to five such global events.

		<p id="trading">After the first global event is revealed, trading begins with the player who rolls highest on a d6 (in the event of a tie for highest, the players who tied keep rolling until one rolls higher) and continuing clockwise. During each player's turn, they may do any one of the following:
			<br><b>Produce:</b> Add any number of a single type of commodity to your reserves. Pay half the market value for that commodity into the market, using either your native currency or gold.
			<br><b>Sell:</b> Move any number of <a href="#commodities">commodities</a> from your <a href="#reservebank">reserves</a> to the <a href="#market">market</a>.
			<br><b>Buy:</b> Purchase units of a single commodity available on the market; move them from the top of the stack in the market to your reserves. For each unit you purchase, pay the player who produced it the market value using either your native currency or gold.
			<br><b>Exchange:</b> Exchange any currency or gold in your reserves for an amount of currency of equal value from the market.
			<br><b>Mine:</b> Add one unit of gold to your reserves.
			<br><b>Print:</b> If you have more gold than native currency in reserves, add up to the difference in native currency to your reserves.i
			<br><b>Draw:</b> Forego other trades in order to draw a new achievement card. If you do, gain one volatility point.
		</p>

		<p>Players may claim achievements from achievement cards at any time during trading.</p>

		<p>Trading continues for the number of rounds indicated on the global event. Once that number of rounds has elapsed, pause to resolve the effects on the global event card. Then flip the next global event card. Each player draws a new achievement card and satisfies their consumption requirement, if able (if not, gain a volatility point). Then trading begins again.</p>
		
		<p>After five global events are resolved, each player counts up their achievements, adding any <a href="#achievements">bonus achievements</a>, and subtracting any volatility points. The player with the highest total is the winner.</p>

		<p>In the event of a tie, the player among those who tied with the most gold in reserves is the winner. If two or more tied players have the same amount of gold, the tied player with the most valuable total reserve holdings (relative to gold) is the winner.</p>
