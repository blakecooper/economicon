		<h2>Welcome to Economicon!</h2>
		
        <p>When playing Economicon, you are in charge of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank" target="_bank">central bank</a> of a large and prosperous nation. Grow your economy while buying and selling the resources your nation needs to thrive, and you will be the winner!

		<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
			<h4>Updates</h4>
			<p><b>2022-01-12:</b> This version of Economicon focuses on the trading aspect of the game. Thanks to the play testers who have played (suffered) through early versions and offered feedback. This and future versions of Economicon will be more rewarding for your input! :)</p>
		</div>

		<h2>The basic idea</h2>

        <p>Economicon is a trading game based on supply and demand.</p>

        <p>
		You and your fellow players each represent a <b>nation</b>, trying to <b>trade resources</b> and grow your economy in a way that satisfies your nation's <b>mandates</b>.
		</p>

		<p>
		Here's where things get tricky: the trades you make to satisfy current mandates will influence how easy or difficult it is to satisfy your future mandates, by changing the value of your <b>currency</b>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Spending your currency (or <b>gold</b>) puts more of it into circulation. When there's more currency in the <b>market</b>, the number of resources that currency can buy decreases, making future trades more difficult (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand" target="_blank">just like in real life</a>). Particuarly cunning players might even look for ways to devalue other players' currency with their trades, in order to gain a competitive edge (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_intervention" target="_blank">just like in real life</a>).
		</p>
		<p>
Enter into "trade agreements" with other players so everyone can satisfy their mandates. Or, engage in a secret campaign to make others' currency worthless, until you're holding all the purchasing power. In Economicon, the choice is up to you!
		</p>
        
		<h2>Setting up the game</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Each player chooses a nation</li>
		<li>Place the starting resources in your <b>reserves</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Gold:</b> 2 units</li>
			<li><b>Native currency:</b> 3 units</li>
			<li><b>Oil:</b> 5 units</li>
			<li><b>Electricity:</b> 3 units</li>
			<li><b>Technology:</b> 1 unit</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
		<li>Set up the <b>market</b>:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Gold:</b> 4 units</li>
                <li><b>Currency:</b> 6 units each</li>
                <li><b>Oil:</b> 9 units</li>
		<li><b>Electricity:</b> 5 units</li>
		<li><b>Technology:</b> 1 unit</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
		<li>Place the <b>draw piles</b> for the 8 tradable units in the center of the play area</li>
            <li>Each player draws two <b>mandate</b> cards
            </li>
        </ol>

		<h2>Playing the game</h2>
        <p>Roll a die to see who goes first. Moving clockwise, players take turns in which they can:
        <ol>
		<li>Take any 1 of the following <b>growth</b> actions:
    		<ul>
			<li><b>Mint</b> either 1 gold or 2 native currency, adding it to your reserves</li>
			<li><b>Drill</b> for 3 oil, adding it to your reserves</li>
			<li><b>Manufacture</b> resources, discarding either 3 oil from reserves to draw 2 electricity, or discarding 2 electricity to draw 1 technology</li>
			<li><b>Draw</b> mandates (a player may have up to 3 unsatisfied mandates at once)</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Then, take <em>either</em> a second growth action, or <b>1</b> of the following <b>trade</b> actions:
		<ul>
			
			<li><b>Sell</b>:
				<ul><li><b>To another player</b>: place the amount of resources you wish to sell from your reserves in front of your play area where others can see, and declare publicly that you are selling them. The sale is complete when another player buys them.</li>
					<li><b>On the market</b>: place the resources you wish to sell into the market; there must be available spots in the corresponding resource column to complete the trade. Then, take from the market an equivalent amount of your native currency, or gold and place it into your reserves.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Buy</b>:
        		<ul>
				<li><b>From another player</b>: if a player is offering the resources you wish to buy for sale, pay that player an equivalent amount of your native currency (or gold). Then, take the resources for sale and place them in your reserves.</li>
				<li><b>From the market:</b> if the desired amount of resources are available in the market, you may pay any currency (not just your native currency), or gold. Place your payment in the corresponding column in the market, then take the resources from the market and place them in your reserves.</li>
				</ul>
        
						<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
			<h4>Notes on buying</h4>
							<p><b>"Splitting" purchases is not allowed.</b> For example, if you want to buy 3 oil from another player, you <em>must</em> buy a single sale offer for 3 oil from a single player; buying 1 oil from three different players is not allowed, nor is buying 3 oil from a 5-oil sale offer. <b>Overpaying is allowed</b> if an exact trade is not available.</p></div>
        
			</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
		</p>			
<p>The goal of Economicon is to use trading to satisfy your nation's mandates. Your mandates are satisfied immediately whenever their conditions are met; it does not have to be your turn.</p>

		<p>The game ends once a player has satisfied <b>5</b> mandates.</p>
           
		<h2>The Market</h2>
		
		<p>Trading is the key to success in Economicon. When players can't (or don't want to) trade amongst themselves, they can trade using the market instead. </p>

<p>In the market there are 8 columns representing each tradable unit (three resources, four currencies, and gold). When trading in the market, players always take units from, and add units to, the top of the column; there are 12 available spots for each type of unit.</p>

		<p><b>Currency and gold</b>: The columns for currency and gold have a number in each available slot. The bottom-most visible number in each column represents the <b>X</b> value on the corresponding units. This number indicates how many resources a single unit of that currency can buy; for example, if the bottom-most visible number in the column for gold is 5, then the X on each unit of gold is equal to 5, and each unit can purchase 5 units of any resource.

		<p><b>Resources</b>: When a resource column is full, it is said to be <b>saturated</b>. When the market is saturated with a particular resource, no more resources of that type may be <em>sold</em> until a player buys at least one unit of that resource from the market, removing the saturated condition.</p>

		<p>When a resource column is empty, it is said to be <b>scarce</b>. When a resource is scarce in the market, no more resources of that type may be <em>bought</em> until a player sells at least one unit of that resource to the market, removing the scarce condition.</p>
		
		<h2>Winning the game</h2>

<p>Once a player has satisfied 5 mandates, trading stops immediately. Each player adds up their victory points:
    <ul>
	    <li><b>Each satisfied mandate</b>: 5 points</li>
    	<li>Each unit in reserves:
        <ul>
		<li><b>Technology</b>: 3</li>
		<li><b>Electricity</b>: 2</li>
		<li><b>Oil</b>: 1</li>
		<li><b>Gold</b>: X</li>
		<li><b>Currency</b>: X</li>
		</ul>
	    </li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p>The value of gold and currency units are equal to their market value.</p>

<p>The player with the most victory points is the winner. In the event of a tie, the player with more <em>units</em> of gold in reserves (regardless of value) wins. If there's still a tie, the winner is the player with the most units of total currency (theirs and other players'). If players remain tied based on victory points, units of gold and units of currency, the game is a draw.</p>
