			<h1><b>Economicon</b></h1>
            <h4>A game of macroeconomics and trading</h4>
			<p>Rules Document v. 0.2
			<br>Updated 2020-01-28</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>Welcome to Economicon!</h2>
		
        <p>When playing Economicon, you assume the role of the mightiest of all bureaucrats: the central banker. Your goal is to achieve a stable economy and a prosperous nation, while contending with mandates from lawmakers and navigating chaotic global events.

		<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
			<h4>Updates</h4>
			<p><b>2020-01-28:</b> Now you can <a href="economicon-reference-0_2.pdf" target="_blank">download the new, handy Economicon rules reference card (v. 0.2)</a>.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>The basic idea</h2>

        <p><b>Economicon is a resource trading game</b> where the value of things change based on supply and demand.</p>

        <p>You and your fellow players will each be trying to claim personal and public achievements through trading. Every trade you make has the potential to affect the value of your (and your fellow players') personal holdings, which might include gold, commodities (like grain, steel, oil and tech) and currency (both yours and that of other players).</p>
        
        <p>Every achievement you claim counts toward your victory points. But certain actions, like having unclaimed mandates or failing to respond to certain global events, will earn you volatility points, which count against you.</p> 
        
        <p>At the end of the game, the player with the most victory points wins.</p>

		<h2>Setting up the game</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Choose your nation:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Blue</b> produces <u>one extra tech</u> for free, but <u>cannot produce grain</u></li>
                    <li><b>Green</b> produces <u>one extra grain</u> for free, but <u>cannot produce oil</u></li>
                    <li><b>White</b> produces <u>one extra steel</u> for free, but <u>cannot produce tech</u></li>
                    <li><b>Red</b> produces <u>one extra oil</u> for free, but <u>cannot produce steel</u></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Set up your reserve bank:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Gold:</b> 10 units</li>
                    <li><b>Native currency:</b> 8 units            
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Set up the markets:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Gold:</b> 4 units</li>
                <li><b>Grain:</b> 4 units (randomly chosen)</li>
                <li><b>Steel:</b> 4 units (randomly chosen)</li>
                <li><b>Oil:</b> 2 units (randomly chosen)</li>
                <li><b>Tech:</b> 1 unit (randomly chosen)</li>
                <li><b>Currency:</b> 1 unit from each player</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Draw two <b>mandate cards</b> for your nation
            </li>
            <li>Determine the <b>starting player</b>--roll a d6. Highest roll goes first. Players tied for highest keep rolling until one player rolls highest.
            </li>
        </ol>

		<h2>Playing the game</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Draw a <b>global event card</b></li>
            <li>Beginning with the starting player and moving clockwise, <b>trade</b> for the number of rounds on the global event card (or until otherwise specified). During your turn, take <u>one</u> of the following <b>trade actions</b>:
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Produce:</b> Pay to add any number of units of a single commodity to your reserves. Pay half the market  value, from your reserves into the markets.</li>
            <li><b>Sell:</b> Move any number of a single commodity from your reserves into the markets, to be bought by other players.</li>
            <li><b>Buy:</b> Pay to move any number of a single commodity from the top of its market stack into your reserves. Pay each player who produced them the market value directly.</li>
            <li><b>Exchange:</b> Trade any number of a single currency (or gold) in your reserves for an amount of currency (or gold) of equal value from the markets.</li>
            <li><b>Mine:</b> Add two units of gold to your reserves.</li>
            <li><b>Print:</b> If you have more gold than native currency in reserves, add up to the difference in native currency to your reserves.</li>
            <li><b>Draw:</b> Draw a new mandate card.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br>During your turn, you can also claim an achievement from a mandate card. When you do, place the mandate card face-up in your play area.

			<h4>Determining the value of gold, currency and comodities</h4>
            <p><b>Don't forget:</b> In Economicon, the value of things change based on supply and demand.</p>
            <p>At any given time, <b>the value of <u>one unit</u> equals:</b></p>
            <p>The number of units in the markets of the type you're trading <b>with</b></p>
            <p><b>-divided by-</b></p>
            <p>The number of the units in the markets of the type you're trading <b>for</b></p>
		</div>

		<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
			<h4>Example</h4>
            
			<p>Say you have a pile of gold burning a hole in your reserve bank, and you need to buy 2 grain to meet your nation's consumption requirement.
			
            <p>There are currently <b>5 gold</b> in the market, and <b>7 grain</b>. So the cost for each unit of grain is <b>5/7</b> = roughly .71 gold per unit of grain. <b>Rounding goes to the nearest .25 in Economicon</b>, so <b>each unit of grain cost .75 gold.</b> You pay 1.5 gold from reserves, and the grain is yours! 
			
            <p>The player after you had exactly the same idea: they want to spend their gold to buy 2 grain. Now there are <b>5 grain</b> in the market. <b>So when the next player goes to buy 2 grain, each unit will cost 5/5 = 1 unit of gold.</b>
			<p>The next player will pay more because grain is now scarcer, and therefore more valuable. 
		</div>
                
            </li>
            <li><b>Resolve the global event</b> by declaring it a success or failure and taking the card's corresponding action.</li>
            <li>Pay your nation's <b>consumption requirement</b>. Discard one of each commodity in your reserves for every unclaimed mandate card you hold. If you cannot pay your nation's consumption requirement, gain a <b>volatility point.</b></li>
        <li>Draw a new mandate card for your nation.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 1 - 4 until five global events have been resolved.</li>
        </ol>
		
		<h2>Winning the game</h2>

        <p><b>The winner of Economicon is the player with the most victory points</b> after five global events have been resolved.</p>

        <p>To determine how many victory points you have:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><b>Add your achievements</b> from claimed mandates and responses to global events.</li>
            <li><b>Add victory points for each bonus achievement</b> you can claim:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Commodities trader (1 point):</b> Hold more total commodities than any other player in reserves</li>
                <li><b>Forex trader (1 point):</b> Hold more total currency than any other player in reserves</li>
                <li><b>Most stable economy (2 points):</b> Have 0 volatility points (multiple players may earn)</li>
                <li><b>Full faith and confidence (5 points):</b> Hold more gold than any other player in reserves</li>
                <li><b>Most valuable economy (7 points):</b> Hold most valuable total reserves (relative to the value of gold)</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Subtract your volatility points.</b></li>
            <li><b>Subtract every unclaimed mandate you hold.</b></li>
        </ol>
