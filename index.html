			<h1><b>Economicon</b></h1>
            <h4>A game of macroeconomics and trading</h4>

		<h2>Welcome to Economicon!</h2>
		
        <p>When playing Economicon, you assume the role of the mightiest of all bureaucrats: the central banker. Your goal is to achieve a stable economy and a prosperous nation, while contending with mandates from lawmakers and navigating chaotic global events.

			<h4>Updates</h4>
			<p><b>2020-02-03:</b> Another play test, another update! <a href="economicon-reference-0_3.pdf" target="_blank">Download the latest Economicon rules reference card (v. 0.3) here</a>.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>The basic idea</h2>

        <p><b>Economicon is a trading game</b> where the value of things change based on supply and demand.</p>

        <p>You and your fellow players will each be trying to complete personal and public objectives through trading. But be careful: every trade you make has the potential to affect the value of your (and your fellow players') personal holdings, which might include gold, commodities (like grain, oil and tech) and currency (both yours and that of other players).</p>
        
        <p>The more objectives you complete, and the more valuable your economy, the more victory points you earn. But certain actions, like failing to meet the consumption demands of your citizens or responding poorly to certain global events, will earn you volatility points. At the end of the game, the player with the most victory points wins, <b>as long as they don't have three or more volatility points.</b></p>
        
		<h2>Setting up the game</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Choose your nation and place the corresponding reserve bank in front of you.</li>
            <li>Set up your reserve bank:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Gold:</b> 10 units</li>
                    <li><b>Native currency:</b> 8 units            
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Set up the market:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Gold:</b> 4 units</li>
                <li><b>Others:</b> 1 unit each
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Draw two <b>mandate cards</b> for your nation
            </li>
            <li>Determine the <b>starting player</b>--roll a d6. Highest roll goes first. Players tied for highest keep rolling until one player rolls highest.
            </li>
        </ol>

		<h2>Playing the game</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Draw a <b>global event card</b></li>
            <li>Beginning with the starting player and moving clockwise, each player takes their turn. This continues for the number of rounds on the global event card.
            <br>During your turn, take <u>two</u> actions:
        <ul>
            <li>First, take a <b>genearate</b> action:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Produce:</b> Pay either gold or your native currency to add an equivalent amount (see <a href="#valuecounts">"Using value counts"</a>) of any one commodity to your reserves. For every number of commodites you produce equal to its value count, gain one additional commodity.</li>
                <li><b>Mine gold:</b> Add two units of gold to your reserves.</li>
                <li><b>Print currency:</b> If you have more gold than your native currency in reserves, add up to the difference in native currency to your reserves. Then, pay one gold.</li>
                <li><b>Draw a new mandate card.</b> Then, discard one mandate card.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Second, you may take another generate action, or <b>trade</b>:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Trade:</b> exchange units of one type in your reserves for an equivalent amount (see <a href="#valuecounts">"Using the value counts"</a>) of another type from the market.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Commodities</b> can only be traded for <b>gold</b> or <b>your native currency</b>.</li>
                    <li><b>Currency</b> (excluding your native currency) can only be traded for another currency (including gold).</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <br>At any time during your turn, when you complete a mandate, you can either <b>claim a victory point</b> or <b>remove a volatility point</b>. 
                
            </li>
            <li><b>Resolve the global event</b> by declaring it a success or failure, then taking the corresponding action.</li>
            <li>Resolve your nation's <b>consumption requirement</b>. Discard one of each commodity in your reserves for every uncompleted mandate card you hold. If you cannot pay your nation's consumption requirement, gain a <b>volatility point</b>.</li>
        <li>Draw a new mandate card.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 1 - 4 until five global events have been resolved.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2 id="valuecounts">Using value counts</h2>
            <p>Everything in the market has a <b>value</b> count, a number that determines how many units of that type should be traded for units of another type.</p>

            <p>Value counts start at 1 (for anything with fewer than 5 units available in the market), and increase by 1 every time the number of units in the market hits a multiple of five (so 5 units have a value count of 2, 10 units have a value count of 3 and so on).</p>

		<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
			<h4>Example: using value counts</h4>
            
            <p>Any time you <b>produce</b> a commodity or execute a <b>trade</b> of any kind, you will compare value counts to determine how much of one thing to pay or trade for another.</p>

            <p><b>When producing a commodity</b>, first pay an amount of either gold or your native currency equal to its value count. Then, add an amount of any one commodity to your reserves equal to that commodity's value count, plus one additional unit (this is a benefit unique to production, unrelated to the value count).</p>

            <p><b>When trading</b>, you will always get an amount of something equal to its value count by exchanging an amount of something else equal to its value count.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Winning the game</h2>

        <p>The winner of Economicon is the player with the most victory points after five global events have been resolved <b>without having three or greater volatility points.</b></p>
        
        <div class="bd-callout bd-callout-danger">
			<h4>Any player with three or greater volatility points <u>cannot</u> win the game!</h4>
			<p>You can remove volatility points by completing mandates or succeeding in global events.</p>
		</div>

        <p>To determine how many victory points you have, <b>add your victory points</b> from claimed mandates and responses to global events. Then, <b>add additional victory points</b> for each bonus achievement you can claim:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Commodities trader (1 point):</b> Hold more total commodities than any other player in reserves</li>
            <li><b>Forex trader (1 point):</b> Hold more total currency than any other player in reserves</li>
            <li><b>Most stable economy (2 points):</b> Have 0 volatility points (multiple players may earn)</li>
            <li><b>Full faith and confidence (5 points):</b> Hold more gold than any other player in reserves</li>
            <li><b>Most valuable economy (5 points):</b> Hold most valuable total reserves (relative to the value of gold)</li>
        </ul>
