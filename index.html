			<h1><b>Economicon</b></h1>
            <h4>A trading game of supply and demand</h4>
			<p>Rules Document v. 0.3
			<br>Updated 2020-08-30</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>Welcome to Economicon!</h2>
		
        <p>When playing Economicon, you are in charge of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank" target="_bank">central bank</a> of a large and prosperous nation. Try to grow your economy while navigating chaotic global events and satisfying the mandates of your nation. Claim the most achievements, and limit dangerous volatility, and you will be the winner!

		<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
			<h4>Updates</h4>
			<p><b>2020-02-03:</b> Another play test, another update! Version 0.3 features less math (to the relief of the regular playtesters!), and is generally stripped down to the core trading concept. Future releases will include things like currency pegging, lending and borrowing money, maybe even asymmetric nation abilities. Who knows?</p>
		</div>

		<h2>The basic idea</h2>

        <p><b>Economicon is a trading game</b> based on supply and demand.</p>

        <p>
You and your fellow players will each represent a nation, trying to <b>trade resources</b> and <b>grow your economy</b> in a way that benefits your nation and satisfies its <b>mandates</b>. At the same time, you'll have to work together to respond to <b>global events</b>, steering everyone toward a positive outcome and away from <b>volatility</b> that could crash your economy.
		</p>

		<p>
		Here's where things get tricky: many of the actions you take, especially trading, will affect how many resources are available in the <b>market</b>. When the supply of resources in the market goes up or down, the <b>value</b> of those resources change based on supply and demand: when more of a resource is available in the market, it becomes less valuable, and more of that resource is needed to trade for something else. Buying, selling and holding the right resources is critical in Economicon, but even the best-laid plans can be destroyed by the fluctuations of the market... brought on by you and your fellow players.
		</p>

		<p>Satisfying mandates and successfully responding to global events can both earn you <b>achievements</b>. To win Economicon, claim more achievements than your fellow players, while also avoiding <b>volatility</b> (which can happen when players fail to respond to global events). Good luck!</p>
        
		<h2>Setting up the game</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Choose your nation</li>
            <li>Place the starting resources in your bank:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Gold:</b> 10 units</li>
                    <li><b>Native currency:</b> 8 units            
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Set up the market:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Gold:</b> 6 units</li>
                <li><b>Others:</b> 4 units each</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Each player draws two <b>mandate</b> cards
            </li>
        </ol>

		<h2>Playing the game</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Draw a <b>global event</b> card.</li>
			<li>Players take <b>turns</b> for the number of rounds indicated on the global event. Each turn, players take <b>2</b> actions: 
					<p></p>
				<ol>
					<li>Start your turn by taking a <b>growth</b> action, which can be any of the following:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Produce:</b> Pay gold or your native currency into the market to add an <a class="indoc" href="#value">equal value</a> of any one commodity to your bank. These new commodities are added from out of play (not from the market).</li>
                <li><b>Mine gold:</b> Add two gold to your bank from out of play.</li>
                <li><b>Print currency:</b> If there is more gold in your bank than your native currency, add the difference in native currency to your bank from out of play. Then, pay one gold.</li>
                <li><b>Draw mandate:</b>Add a mandate card to your hand</li>
            </ul></li>
					<li>Next, you may take another growth action, or take a <b>trade</b> action instead: exchange an amount of any single resource in your bank for an <a href="#value">equivalent value</a> of another resource in the market.
                	
				<ul>
						<li><b>Currency</b> can only be traded for <b>currency</b>.</li>
						<li><b>Commodities</b> can only be traded for <b>commodities</b>.</li>
						<li>Exceptions to these rules are <b>Gold</b> and <b>your native currency</b>. These are universal resources for that can be traded for <b>any other resource</b> (and vice versa).</li> 
				</ul></li>
            
			</ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <br>At any time during your turn, when you complete a mandate, you can either <b>claim an achievement</b> or <b>remove a volatility point</b>. 
                
            </li>
            <li><b>Resolve the global event</b> by determing success or failure, based on the card. Then, take the corresponding action on the card.</li>
        <li>Each player draws a new mandate card.</li>
		<li>Repeat steps 1 - 4 until <b>5</b> global events have been resolved.</li>
        </ol>
		
		<h2>Winning the game</h2>

        <p>The winner of Economicon is the player with the most achievements after 5 global events have been resolved <b>without having three or greater volatility points.</b></p>
        
        <div class="bd-callout bd-callout-danger">
			<h4>Any player with three or greater volatility points <u>cannot</u> win the game!</h4>
			<p>You can remove volatility points by completing mandates or succeeding in global events.</p>
		</div>

        <p>To determine your total achievements, add your achievements from completed mandates and successful global events, then claim any bonus achievements:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Commodities trader (1 bonus achievement):</b> Hold more total commodities in your bank than any other player</li>
            <li><b>Forex trader (1 bonus achievement):</b> Hold more currency in your bank than any other player</li>
            <li><b>Most stable economy (2 bonus achievements):</b> Have 0 volatility points (multiple players may earn)</li>
            <li><b>Full faith and confidence (3 bonus achievements):</b> Hold more gold in your bank than any other player</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h2 id="value">Value</h2>
			<p>
				Every resources in the market has a unique <b>value</b>. When trading, look at the <b>values</b> of the units you're trading. These are the number of units needed for a fair trade.
			</p>

            <p>
				The <b>value</b> of all units starts at <b>1</b>. For every <b>5</b> of a unit in the market, the value count increases by 1.
			</p>

		<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
			<h4>Example: Using values when trading</h4>
			<p>You are using your <b>trade</b> action to trade <b>grain</b> for <b>gold</b>. If grain's value is <b>3</b> and gold's value is <b>1</b>, then a fair trade would be <b>3</b> grain for <b>1</b> gold.
